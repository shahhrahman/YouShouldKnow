YSK that Spotify does not automatically renew Premium for Students

Just realized that my Spotify Premium for Students plan is no longer in place and that I have been paying $9.99 rather than the original $4.99. Make sure that, if you are on this plan, you continue to manually renew your Spotify Student plan every 12 months.
